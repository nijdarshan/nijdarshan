### Hi there 👋

🤗 First of all, thank you for taking your time out to pay me a visit. 🙏

🖥️ Computational Neuroscience is where my keen interest lies. Right now, I'm just building the basement. My current forte is DevOps, in which I have loved the way 🐋Containers and ☸️ Kubernetes have changed the game. Automation is something I have always enjoyed! 

✅ I believe the ability to think is what matters the most in an individual's development. So, I want to bring awareness and make all the minds (especially younger) THINK! 🧠

⭕pensource is something that am exploring, and I strongly believe in the community 

💻 I love to develop Machine Learning models to make our world a better place; hence I have learned (and keep improving) the following skills:

➪ Python and Java ⌨️  
➪ HTML/CSS and WordPress Development 🕸️  
➪ Data Analytics (🐍 libraries), Google Analytics, Power BI 📊  
➪ Machine Learning Algorithms ~ when to use what! ⚙️  
➪ Docker Containers and Kubernetes Orchestration 🐳 + ☸️  
➪ Git, GitHub, Terraform... (more to come)  
➪ Search Engine Optimization and Keyword Research 🕵  

And a highly concentrated interest to learn, teach, and develop every day! This is what motivates me. 😇

👏 If you have read till here, I really would like to connect with you and have a cup of tea! ☕ 

😊 Let us be grateful for everything! Good luck 👋

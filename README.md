Iâ€™m a researcher committed to making AI more than a chat paradigm, by building Deep Learning use cases, that could solve problems and help the world become a better place. I thrive in a non-stop hackathon environment where I can build foundation models for language, vision, code, and science, while quantizing LLMs.
